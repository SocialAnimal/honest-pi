Social media applications are extending the one-directional static e-Government paradigm beyond information presentation and service delivery. They allow for bidirectional exchanges with citizens and across levels of government. Social media applications include social sharing, content creation, content curation and open innovation platforms. In the public sector, social media tools are used to increase citizen participation, transparency of government processes and decision making as well as collaboration with stakeholders and other government organizations.
